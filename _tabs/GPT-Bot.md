Technology is cool. I created a [custom ChatGPT chatbot](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-rd9HDFH4j-cs-research-advisor-for-undergraduates) that will answer your questions regarding undergraduate research.

It works by starting out as a generic ChatGPT chatbot using GPT-4. But since the current model has very limited data on undergraduate research (especially [REUs](/posts/where-to-find-undergraduate-computer-science-research-programs/)), I further trained it by feeding it my blog posts and presentation outlines regarding the research process. The topics and advice I didn't cover in those documents were added later through conversations with the bot. The idea is that the bot would answer any questions the same way I would.

Of course, the bot is not limited to the data I give it. GPT-4 has the ability to surf the web. I provided the bot with a list of online resources—including this website—so that all information is up-to-date.
