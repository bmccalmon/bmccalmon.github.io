## What is an **REU**?

The **National Science Foundation** (NSF) is a federal agency that sponsors scientific research programs all over the United States.

**Research Experiences for Undergraduates** (REU) sites are programs funded by NSF to carry out such research. These sites are hosted by colleges, universities, and research centers all around the country. A typical REU will provide free housing, travel reimbursements, a food allowance, and a stipend to accepted students. Not to mention the _very_ valuable research experience, especially if you plan on attending graduate school. If you reside in the U.S. and are enrolled in a university or college, you are eligible to participate.

Most programs run for 8-10 weeks in the summer, but some occur during the fall/spring semesters.

## What do you do in an REU?

A typical REU occurs during the summer. Once accepted, the program coordinator will get in touch with you to set up travel arrangements and payment accounts for direct deposit.

Once you arrive, you will have some time to get settled onto your new campus. The site will have you live in a single or double room, depending on the program. You will probably get a parking pass near your dorm (if driving up), but you won't get reimbursed for any gas spent while the program is active.

The first couple weeks will involve helpful workshops and getting you introduced to the project(s) and project leads. The remaining weeks are spent actually doing the research. In the final week, you will present your research project at a symposium and possibly add finishing touches to your paper.

## Where do you find REU programs?

NSF has a [listing](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) where program coordinators can advertise their REU programs. Luckily, you can sort by the subject in which you are interested. For example, there are categories for computer science, astronomical science, environmental science, physics, psychology, and a lot more. If you study STEM, chances are there is a program for you.

Each item in the listing includes information about the location, school, coordinators, and the general topic of the program. You can click `Abstract of Reward` to view more information about their NSF grant if you are interested in that sort of thing. Clicking that link also gives your more information on where to apply for that specific program. Most programs use the **NSF ETAP portal**, but some host their own application forms.

## How do you apply for REU programs?

I will briefly go over the general application process for these research programs, but if you want a more in-depth guide and tips and tricks to write the best application, check out my other articles.

### The NSF ETAP Portal

Most programs utilize the [NSF ETAP portal](https://etap.nsf.gov/). This portal serves as a centralized place to write and organize your application materials, making it easier to apply to more than one REU.

First, you set up an account with your basic personal details. Then, you upload your **personal statement**, **resume**, and **unofficial transcript** without the need to re-upload them for each application. You also send **recommendation letter** invites from there.

The ETAP portal also serves as an additional listing where you can browse available REU programs, filtered by your area of interest.

A few weeks after you submit your application, you will receive an email notifying you whether you were accepted/rejected. There is no need to check your applicaiton status on the portal.
